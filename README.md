**Data Act Report :-**  

**Research Questions:** 

1. Does the dog having a name or stage have anything to do with them having high rates? 

We started this by observing the difference between mean of rates of dogs having either a name or a stage and those who don’t have both, we observed the difference in mean between those respectively is 0.85 

Our hypothesis is as follow :-

Under assumption that null hypothesis is true , the position of the observed difference under the null distribution is illustrated in Figure 1 

With a corresponding **P-value =**  **0**, which means that we reject the null, and dogs with either names or stages have higher rates than those without both.
